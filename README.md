# Zomato-Restaurant-Clustering-and-Sentiment-Analysis
This project centers around Zomato, a prominent online food delivery platform. It involves two key datasets: one for restaurant information and the other for user reviews.

The initial phase of this project involved rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the data's suitability for comprehensive analysis. Subsequently, we conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on both datasets, providing insights into the dataset's composition and features.

The core analytical components of this project encompassed K-means clustering to group similar restaurants, and sentiment analysis of user reviews. To visually interpret the sentiment analysis results, we utilized an LDA visualizer. Furthermore, we compared the results with supervised methods to obtain a more profound understanding.

In conclusion, this project offers a detailed exploration of Zomato's restaurant and review datasets, shedding light on clustering, sentiment analysis, and visualization to provide valuable insights for informed decision-making in the food industry.
